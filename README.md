**Title: Second Hand Car Dealer Project**


**Objective:**

The objective of the second-hand car dealer project is to design and implement a MySQL database system that efficiently manages the inventory, sales, and customer interactions of a second-hand car dealership. The emphasis is on creating and optimizing SQL queries to perform various operations on the database.

**Description:**

**A) Database Design:**
Tables: Create tables such as cars (for car details), customers (for customer information), sales (for sales transactions), and employees (for employee records).

Relationships: Establish relationships between tables using foreign keys, such as linking sales to specific cars and customers, and employees to sales.

Attributes: Define attributes for each table, including car make, model, year, price, customer name, contact details, sales date, employee ID, and commission.
to specific cars and customers, and employees to sales.


**B) Query Examples:**
Inventory Queries:
- Retrieve all cars available in stock.
- Filter cars based on make, model, year, or price range.
- Display cars sorted by price or mileage.

Customer Queries:
- Add new customers to the database.
- Update customer information (e.g., address, phone number).


Sales Queries:
- Record a new sale with details such as car sold, customer ID, salesperson ID, and commission.
- Calculate total sales revenue for a specific period.
- Identify top-performing salespeople based on sales volume or revenue.

Employee Queries:
- Add new employees to the system.
- Update employee details (e.g., job title, contact information).
- Retrieve a list of employees in a particular department.

Reporting Queries:
- Generate a monthly sales report with total revenue, top-selling cars, and sales trends.
- Calculate average sales commission for each employee.
- Identify customers who made multiple purchases.

Maintenance Queries:
- Backup and restore the database regularly.
- Optimize database performance by indexing frequently accessed columns.
- Monitor database health and handle any data integrity issues.


By designing the MySQL database system and focusing on writing efficient SQL queries, the second-hand car dealer project can effectively manage its inventory, sales, 
customer relationships, and employee operations, leading to improved productivity and customer satisfaction.
